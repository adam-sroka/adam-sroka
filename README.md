# Hey there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adam-sroka/adam-sroka/master/img/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm Adam, and I'm currently in my final year of the Information and Computer Engineering masters at Cambridge University 🎓. I have experience with Python, having used it in most on my projects, I also know some C++ and I'm currently delving a bit into Dart and Flutter. My coding experience has shifted from data science, having started with development of recommender systems 🤖, into app development, and I'm looking to move more into production-oriented software engineering 💻. I love learning ❤️, and I'm always on the lookout for new technologies to add to my skills. On that note, I'm very open to any meaningful opportunities; please visit my [website](https://adamsroka.io) or get in touch 😊.
