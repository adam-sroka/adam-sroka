# Hey there!

I'm Adam, and I've just finished my Masters degree in Information and Computer Engineering at Cambridge University ðŸŽ“. I have experience with Python, having used it in most on my projects, I also know some C++ and I'm currently delving a bit into Dart and Flutter. My coding experience has shifted from data science, having started with development of recommender systems ðŸ¤–, into app development, and I'm looking to move more into production-oriented software engineering ðŸ’». I love learning ðŸ’™, and I'm always on the lookout for new technologies to add to my skills. On that note, I'm very open to meaningful opportunities; please visit my [website](https://adam.sr) or get in touch ðŸ˜Š.
