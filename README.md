# Hey there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adam-sroka/adam-sroka/master/img/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm Adam, and I'm currently in my third year of the Information and Computer Engineering masters at Cambridge University :mortar_board:. I'm passionate about Python :snake: and I've been using it in most on my projects, which have varied in the amount of data science sprinkled in :sparkles:. Having been involved with prototype development of recommender systems :robot: for some time, I am now looking to expand my experience with more production-oriented software engineering :computer:. I love learning :heart:, and I'm always on the lookout for new technologies to add to my skills. In that note, I'm very open to any meaningful opportunities; please visit my [website](https://adamsroka.io) or get in touch:blush:.
